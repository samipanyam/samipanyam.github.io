    <h2>Pollution indoors</h2>
    <h5>August 19th, 2023</h5>
    <p>
     
    Today I learned how I can keep my indoor space free of pollution. I learned that a lot of things can cause germs to spread like Humidity and moisture. I also learned that pollutants such as CO and Radon can be in your air too. These diffferent air pollutants can have both mental and physical effects on the body. One way that scientists say could help is that you should keep open windows and fans near those open windows in order to circulate air. I have a gas stove so it is important for me when I use it to have full circulation of the ventilation. The article also says to think about getting a HEPA filter. I think that this is a good idea. I think that I will try to get one of these. I think that it is very important to keep the air in your house clean. I will try to follow these tips to keep my air clean.

    <h2>Activists in Court</h2>
    <h5>August 14th, 2023</h5>
    <p>
     I read about how young activists were able to win a court case in Montana. The court case was about whether or not the constitutional rights of the activists had been violated by the local governments for not creating measures to stop climate change. I applaud these activists for standing up to the court system. THey have a lot of courage. I hope that the Montana state legislature support this ruling and do not postpone making laws about these issues. If they do, it could end badly for Montana. I hope that the activists continue to fight for their rights and that they continue to fight for Climate change to be stopped for good.

    <h2>A ban on Bags in Kenya </h2>
    <h5>August 9th, 2023</h5>
    <p>
      I read about how banning bags in Kenya has has stopped working. They talk about how bags have been smuggled through other countries. I dont really undersand why they would smuggle the plastic bags in however. Is it cheaper to smuggle bags in than to use bags that are not one time use? I think that this is a very interesting situation. However, I do not think that cracking down on smuggling is going to do much. I think that the place where the government needs to work the most is that they need to educate the people using the bags about the price and environment effectiveness of non single use bags. This would kill two birds with one stone, It would decrease smuggling and it would stop the people who are using the plastic bags from using them. I hope the goats stop ingesting plastic and stop dying from this

    <h2>Less Ice in Antartica</h2>
    <h5>August 4th, 2023</h5>
    <p>
      Today I listened to a podcast about how the ice in Antartica is at record low levels even though it is winter. This is very scary because it means that the ice is melting at a very fast rate. There is a million square miles less of ice in the seas around antartica. The cause of this has been climate change. Everywhere there is a all time record. THe podcast says that this wont be one off. LEss ice makes it easier for more ice to melt which can cause a chain reaction. This means that the oceans will become warmer and warmer. The sea ice protects Antartica's coast lines from melting, which stops ocean levels from rising. If the ice melts, then the ocean levels will rise. This is very scary. We need to stop climate change now.

    <h2>Coral Reefs and Artic Ocean Currents</h2>
    <h5>July 29th, 2023</h5>
    <p> 
      Today I listened to a podcast about coral reefs and how they are dying. I learned how we as tourists can help to stop the corals from bleaching. Coral Bleaching is what happens when a coral loses its color. This is caused by the coral expelling the algae that lives in it. This is caused by the coral being stressed. This is caused by the water being too warm. Coral bleaching is not only bad for the environment, but many people depend on corals for their liveliehood. Some things that we can do to save the reefs as tourists, is to wear reef safe sunscreen like mineral based suncscreen. We can also report coral bleaching to local reef restoration communities.

    <p> 
      I then read about how a specific Artic Ocean current playing a massive role in the climate. This current, the AMOC, is as big as 8000 Mississippi RIvers and could shut down soon. This would be catastrophic. The AMOC plays a big part in warming Europe. If the AMOC collapses it could signal a massive change in the global climate. this could lead to much colder temps. The AMOC collapse would change agriculture and increase disease drastically. We have to stop climate change and stop the AMOC from collapsing. We need to stop climate change now.

    <h2>Honduras Migration</h2>
    <h5>July 24th, 2023</h5>
    <p> 
     It is so sad to read how climate chang eis negatively impacting people's lives. The erratic rainfall caused by climate change is hurting so many people in Honduras. It's getting so bad that thousands of people feel stuck in Honduras. CLimate change has also caused terrible natural disasters. I feel so bad for people in Central America who have to face these terrible disasters. I hope that we can stop climate change and help these people. How can we let this happen. The people who live in Central America also need to live too. We have to stop climate change, so that these people can keep living and live well.

    <h2>Ocean temps</h2>
    <h5>July 19th, 2023</h5>
    <p> 
      Today I read about the rising ocean temps in South florida. It is very interesting the rate at which the temperature is growing. Why is the temperature so much higher than the record last year. One major problem that I read about is that the heat is causing oxygen levels to sink. THis is really bad for the fish. I really hope that the coral doesnt bleach. THat could be destructive for a whole lot of species. We need to stop the carbon from being trapped in the sea. Ocean acidification can destroy ecosystems and is really bad becuase it messes up ph levels. Again, Climatte change and Greenhouse gasses must be reduced.

      <h2> Phoenix national highs</h2>
      <h5>July 14th, 2023</h5>
      <p> 
        Today, I read about how Phoenix has been having serious temperature highs. I read it in this article:https://www.npr.org/2023/07/14/1187646149/phoenix-could-break-its-record-for-longest-hot-spell-as-extreme-heat-persists. I found it very terrifying. Their water was coming out scalding hot, and it was reaching 100 degrees even at night time. How are you supposed to survive like that? One stat that I was shocked by is that at night te temp has grown by 2.5 degrees over 50 years. That is a huge increase. I think that this has a lot to do with the climate change that has been happening. How we have been pumping greenhouse gasses into the environment. We really need to stop this. We need to develop carbon capture technology and decrease our carbon use now.

      <h2>
        Sections 4.1 and 4.2
      </h2>

      <h5>July 9th, 2023</h5>
      <p>
        Chapter 4 talks about how water is managed and used. It specifically talks about the hygrologic cycle and how water is used. I think that it is really interesting how there is so many different types of water storage in groundwater. I always just thought that it was water in the soil.So many calculations dont just deal with volume. They deal with energy, pressure and temperature. There is so much math, and it is very exciting

    <h2>Fungus</h2>
    <h5> July 5th, 2023 </h5>
    <p>
      In the car, I was listening to an NPR podcast, and I found it very interesting. THe podcast was about how fungi could be the next pandemic and that they could cause a pandemic in the near future. It is very scary to see how a deadly fungus could be spreading highly. The thing that really caught my attention was the effect fungi had on wildlife and plants. It is very sad that species can go extinct because of a fungus. I hope that we can come up wiht a way to save the bats. THe one thing that piqued my interest however was the idea that we are making a banana species go extinct. We killed the Gros Michel by having it be our one source of bananas. This led to very little genetic diversity and the fungus was able to kill off the entire species. We are still doing this and could kill the Cavendish. We need to put measures in place so that the Cavendish doesn't go extinct. I think that keeping a ecological balance is very important, and that we should keep the balance intact.

      <h2>Section 3.1, 3.2 </h2>
      <h5> July 4th, 2023 </h5>
      <p>
      Chapter 3 talks about risks and how to manage them. The first section talks about what different types of risks are and how they are defined. The ones they mention include risks from storms and forest fires and such. I wonder how risk management was done during the forest fires that happened just now up in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second section talks about how probability affects a decision. I think that the idea that subjective probability is interesting. It's very interesting how we determine how likely an event is going to happen even without quantitative knowledge. I think it is very interesting how we still need to consider the subjective proabability in our decision making.

     <h2>Section 2.4 </h2>
  <h5>July 3rd, 2023</h5>
  <p>
  section 4 talks about how energy works and how energy is transferred. It is very interesting how I have learned most of this from AP Chemistry.
  They then talk about convection, conduction, and radiation. I think that it is very interesting how radiation is based directly on the energy of the wave. It is also very interesting how we can combine every heat transfer type into one equation.
  The next part of the chapter is about how the second law of thermodynamics says that energy flows from high density to low density. I think it was interesting how they have a equation for the change in entropy. I have never seen that before

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 </h2>
      <h5>July 2st, 2023</h5>

      <p>
        This chapter is about the materials and energy balance system. 
        The underlying idea behind this chapter is that the net change in an environment is the inputs minus the outputs. 
        This makes sense to me and reminds me of the way a drug is cycled through the body.  
        Section 2 moslty talks about conservation of energy and matter. 
        It makes sense that environmental engineers use this as a baseline law because it is so fundemental to keepingg trakc of matter and energy. 
        In section 3, the chapter talks about using simple diagrams to model inputs and outputs to systems. 
        It shows a diagram of a houselhold and the waste to demonstrate this. I think that I might try to create a diagram of my own house. They talk about using differential equations in order to model these changes. I think that this is very interesting and I would like to learn more about this. I think that this is a very interesting way to model the changes in a system. I found it interesting how efficiency is pretty much the same as percent error, but you use inputs and outputs instead of epexted value and experimental value. It is interesting that a reactor is a first order equation and that it is modeled the same way.

      <h2>Section 1.4 and 1.5 </h2>
      <h5>July 1st, 2023</h5>
      
     <p>I am continuing to read the textbook and continuing chapter 1.</p> 
   <p> Section 4 talks mostly about units. I learned a couple of new units from this. These include a Btu, which looks to be a unit of energy just like a kilowatt-hour. I also learned about an acre-foot which is a volume of water. I thought these were pretty interesting.   </p> 
   <p> Section 5 deals with idea that environmental engineers look at interrelated parts and the effects on each part. However, they have to break up the systems into easier more simple ideas. This makes sense as I have done something like this for some coding projects that I have done.  </p> 
   <p> The first system they talk about is the Water system. I think what is interesting is that they took such a complicated ssystem and they broke it down into nice, easy, and digestible steps.</p>
   <p> It is very intesting how the solid waste management looks a lot simpler than the air and water waste management tree, but I imagine that it is just as complicated. </p>

      <h2>First Reading</h2>
      <h5>June 30, 2023</h5>
      
      <p>The first book I will start to read is an "INTRODUCTION TO
        ENVIRONMENTAL
        ENGINEERING" by Mackenzie L. Davis and David A. Cornwell. I think that this will be a good place to start and learn about the basics of environmental engineering. This is my post for the first 2 to 3 parts of the 1st chapter.  </p>
      <p>In the first section, the book talks about what exactly environmental engineering is. I didn't realize that there is a lot more to environmental engineering than controlling pollution in the soil and water. It also deals with the areas of sanitation and water supplies. I learned that it deals with engineering pronblems that come from public health. THis includes arthropod borne diseases. I am now very curious on what those diseases are. </p>
      <p> In the second and third sections, I learned about the rules and codes that an environmental engineer have to follow. These were all very straightforward as they talked about how a environmental engineer must be truthful to the public and use their skills wisely and correctly. However, It is very interesting the idea that some of these rules come into a gray area when issues are more complicated. For example, I think it is interesting  how if the EPA puts a law into place about disinfecting water even if that would kill beneficial microorganisms, you have to make a decision on what to do and how to do it. With my limited knowledge, I would probably follow the EPA's decision, but I think it has to be in the judgement of the engineer.</p>
