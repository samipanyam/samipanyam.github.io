      <h2>Section 2.4 </h2>
      <h5>July 3st, 2023</h5>
      <p>
      section 4 talks about how energy works and how energy is transferred. It is very interesting how I have learned most of this from AP Chemistry.

     They then talk about convection, conduction, and radiation. I think that it is very interesting how radiation is based directly on the energy of the wave. It is also very interesting how we can combine every heat transfer type into one equation.

     The next part of the chapter is about how the second law of thermodynamics says that energy flows from high density to low density. I think it was interesting how they have a equation for the change in entropy. I have never seen that before

      <h2>Section 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 </h2>
      <h5>July 2st, 2023</h5>

      <p>
        This chapter is about the materials and energy balance system. 
        The underlying idea behind this chapter is that the net change in an environment is the inputs minus the outputs. 
        This makes sense to me and reminds me of the way a drug is cycled through the body.  
        Section 2 moslty talks about conservation of energy and matter. 
        It makes sense that environmental engineers use this as a baseline law because it is so fundemental to keepingg trakc of matter and energy. 
        In section 3, the chapter talks about using simple diagrams to model inputs and outputs to systems. 
        It shows a diagram of a houselhold and the waste to demonstrate this. I think that I might try to create a diagram of my own house. They talk about using differential equations in order to model these changes. I think that this is very interesting and I would like to learn more about this. I think that this is a very interesting way to model the changes in a system. I found it interesting how efficiency is pretty much the same as percent error, but you use inputs and outputs instead of epexted value and experimental value. It is interesting that a reactor is a first order equation and that it is modeled the same way.

      <h2>Section 1.4 and 1.5 </h2>
      <h5>July 1st, 2023</h5>
      
     <P>I am continuing to read the textbook and continuing chapter 1.</P> 
   <p> Section 4 talks mostly about units. I learned a couple of new units from this. These include a Btu, which looks to be a unit of energy just like a kilowatt-hour. I also learned about an acre-foot which is a volume of water. I thought these were pretty interesting.   </p> 
   <p> Section 5 deals with idea that environmental engineers look at interrelated parts and the effects on each part. However, they have to break up the systems into easier more simple ideas. This makes sense as I have done something like this for some coding projects that I have done.  </p> 
   <p> The first system they talk about is the Water system. I think what is interesting is that they took such a complicated ssystem and they broke it down into nice, easy, and digestible steps.</p>
   <p> It is very intesting how the solid waste management looks a lot simpler than the air and water waste management tree, but I imagine that it is just as complicated. </p>

      <h2>First Reading</h2>
      <h5>June 30, 2023</h5>
      
      <p>The first book I will start to read is an "INTRODUCTION TO
        ENVIRONMENTAL
        ENGINEERING" by Mackenzie L. Davis and David A. Cornwell. I think that this will be a good place to start and learn about the basics of environmental engineering. This is my post for the first 2 to 3 parts of the 1st chapter.  </p>
      <p>In the first section, the book talks about what exactly environmental engineering is. I didn't realize that there is a lot more to environmental engineering than controlling pollution in the soil and water. It also deals with the areas of sanitation and water supplies. I learned that it deals with engineering pronblems that come from public health. THis includes arthropod borne diseases. I am now very curious on what those diseases are. </p>
      <p> In the second and third sections, I learned about the rules and codes that an environmental engineer have to follow. These were all very straightforward as they talked about how a environmental engineer must be truthful to the public and use their skills wisely and correctly. However, It is very interesting the idea that some of these rules come into a gray area when issues are more complicated. For example, I think it is interesting  how if the EPA puts a law into place about disinfecting water even if that would kill beneficial microorganisms, you have to make a decision on what to do and how to do it. With my limited knowledge, I would probably follow the EPA's decision, but I think it has to be in the judgement of the engineer.</p>

     <p>Hi, My name is Sami!</p>
      <p>Welcome to my environmental engineering blog, where I'll be sharing my experiences, insights, and discoveries as I embark on a meaningful journey towards a more sustainable future. With a passion for the environment and a desire to make a positive impact, I've chosen the field of environmental engineering as my vehicle to drive change. Join me as I explore the fascinating world of environmental engineering and uncover innovative solutions to pressing environmental challenges.</p>
      <p>In this blog I will talk about the scientific articles that I am reading and my thoughts on them. I hope to learn a lot more about environmental engineering through this and increase my presence in the community. I will also be talking about my research projects in environmental engineering.</p>

      <p>Hi there! I'm Sami, a passionate senior at Conestoga High School. My dream is to become an Environmental Engineer and make a positive impact on the world around me. When I'm not studying, I love spending time on my hobbies. Gardening is one of my favorite activities, as it allows me to connect with nature and create something beautiful. I also enjoy playing tennis, which not only keeps me active but also brings out my competitive side. Additionally, going to the gym is an essential part of my routine, as it helps me maintain a healthy lifestyle.  </p>
