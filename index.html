      <p>The first book I will start to read is an "INTRODUCTION TO
        ENVIRONMENTAL
        ENGINEERING" by Mackenzie L. Davis and David A. Cornwell. I think that this will be a good place to start and learn about the basics of environmental engineering. This is my post for the first 2 to 3 parts of the 1st chapter.  </p>

     <p>Hi, My name is Sami!</p>
      <p>Welcome to my environmental engineering blog, where I'll be sharing my experiences, insights, and discoveries as I embark on a meaningful journey towards a more sustainable future. With a passion for the environment and a desire to make a positive impact, I've chosen the field of environmental engineering as my vehicle to drive change. Join me as I explore the fascinating world of environmental engineering and uncover innovative solutions to pressing environmental challenges.</p>
      <p>In this blog I will talk about the scientific articles that I am reading and my thoughts on them. I hope to learn a lot more about environmental engineering through this and increase my presence in the community. I will also be talking about my research projects in environmental engineering.</p>

      <p>Hi there! I'm Sami, a passionate senior at Conestoga High School. My dream is to become an Environmental Engineer and make a positive impact on the world around me. When I'm not studying, I love spending time on my hobbies. Gardening is one of my favorite activities, as it allows me to connect with nature and create something beautiful. I also enjoy playing tennis, which not only keeps me active but also brings out my competitive side. Additionally, going to the gym is an essential part of my routine, as it helps me maintain a healthy lifestyle.  </p>
